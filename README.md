## Introduction:
  In INDIA a common saying goes that “you first do engineering and then follow your passion.”

It is applicable with many students pursuing their engineering from any college be it NITs/ IITs or any engineering college. The main reason behind this is lack of knowledge of the various opportunities which are available. Moreover students fail to know their passion at such a young age and those who even know their passions fail to implement and execute them.

As for knowing of passion of an individual it is a very personal thing and it varies from person to person, whereas for the persons who know their interests but they don’t have any guidance for it, here we would like to come in with our app.

With our app we would:-

1. Help individuals by giving them information about all the possible passions which they can pursue which can be as uncommon as being a stunt person or a wine taster or even a PC gamer etc.
1. We will give them all the insights on which degree they can go for to how much salary an average individual in that field makes to which private classes they can attend for these skills.
3. After gaining the knowledge corresponding to their interests individuals can even apply for jobs available in that field on our app.
4. We have a CHAT WITH EXPERT feature built in our app which facilitates the one on one conversation between the individual who wants to make a career in that field with the one who is already pursing that field.
