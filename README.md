## Introduction:
  In INDIA a common saying goes that “you first do engineering and then follow your passion.”

It is applicable with many students pursuing their engineering from any college be it NITs/ IITs or any engineering college. The main reason behind this is lack of knowledge of the various opportunities which are available. Moreover students fail to know their passion at such a young age and those who even know their passions fail to implement and execute them.

As for knowing of passion of an individual it is a very personal thing and it varies from person to person, whereas for the persons who know their interests but they don’t have any guidance for it, here we would like to come in with our app.
